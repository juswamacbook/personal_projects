BOGGLE Deluxe Game
Welcome to BOGGLE Deluxe, a word-finding puzzle game developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project is designed to offer an engaging and customizable gameplay experience, leveraging OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction for clean, modular code.

Features
Dynamic Board Generation: The game board is randomized each time, ensuring no two games are alike.
Word Validation: Built-in dictionary to validate user-submitted words.
Timer: Players must find as many words as possible within a set time limit.
Scoring System: Words are scored based on length and uniqueness.
Customizable Gameplay:
Adjustable board size (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, etc.).
Configurable time limits.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) (Optional): A user-friendly GUI for seamless gameplay experience (if implemented).
Multiplayer Mode: Compete against friends or challenge yourself in single-player mode.
How It Works
Start the Game:

Launch the game from the command line or GUI.
The game will generate a randomized board of letters.
Gameplay:

Players form words by connecting adjacent letters (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Enter the words into the input field or select letters directly on the GUI.
Scoring:

Each valid word contributes points based on its length:
3-4 letters: 1 point
5-6 letters: 2 points
7+ letters: 3+ points
Duplicate or invalid words score 0 points.
End of Game:

When the timer runs out, the game displays the final score and a list of valid/invalid words.
Multiplayer mode tallies scores for all participants.
